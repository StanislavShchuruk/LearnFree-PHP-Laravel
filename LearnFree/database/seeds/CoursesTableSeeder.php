            understand how the world around you works.',

            'In our highly technological society, it is useful to have 
             a basic understanding of the how and why the world works 
             the way it does: thatâ€™s what physics is all about. 
             It also involves a touch of history, a bit of mathematics, 
             and many everyday examples.
             Before starting this course, you are recommended to have the following equivalent mathematical knowledge:
             Calculus, Elementary statistics, Trigonometry,
             Sine and Cosine graphs, Algebra.
             Physics is concerned with every aspect of our universe, 
             and in Basic Physics you will explore 4 main areas: 
             Motion, Waves & Sound, Electricity & Magnetism, and Light. 
             You will gain some valuable insight into these topics, 
             and be able to make simple calculations and predictions.',
